# UFOs

# Overview
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will need to add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

# Results
We were able to create a clean website that allows users to interact and search for UFO sightings all over the US. 

# Summary
The website is clean and ready to go. Users can filter through the different sitings using the search bars created and can find all the sightings. One recommendation that would help valdate our data would be eye witness counts. I think another filter that would measure distance from your current location would be cool so that users could see the nearest sighting.
